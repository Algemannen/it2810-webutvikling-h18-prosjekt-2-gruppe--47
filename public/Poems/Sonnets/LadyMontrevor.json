  "author": "Christina Rossetti, 1830 - 1894",
  "poem": [
    "I do not look for love that is a dream—",
    "    I only seek for courage to be still;",
    "    To bear my grief with an unbending will,",
    "And when I am a-weary not to seem.",
    "Let the round world roll on; let the sun beam;",
    "    Let the wind blow, and let the rivers fill",
    "    The everlasting sea, and on the hill",
    "The palms almost touch heaven, as children deem.",
    "And, though young spring and summer pass away,",
    "    And autumn and cold winter come again,",
    "    And though my soul, being tired of its pain,",
    "Pass from the ancient earth, and though my clay",
    "    Return to dust, my tongue shall not complain;—",
    "No man shall mock me after this my day."
